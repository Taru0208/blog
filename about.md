I'm Taru. I build developer tools and research the mathematics of game design.

## Developer Tools

- [git-dig](https://github.com/Taru0208/git-dig) — Git history archaeology: hotspots, coupling, knowledge silos
- [codemap](https://github.com/Taru0208/codemap) — Generate a structural overview of any codebase
- [hangul-analyzer](https://github.com/Taru0208/hangul-analyzer) — Structural analysis of Korean text
- [API Forge](https://api-forge.quietnode.workers.dev/docs) — Free utility API with 114 endpoints: text, encoding, color, faker, security, and more

## Game Design Research

- [Theory of Anticipation](https://github.com/Taru0208/anticipation-theory) — Python framework for measuring strategic depth in games
- [Design Lab](https://taru0208.github.io/toa-research/design-lab/) — Play two versions of the same game and feel the difference
- [Calculator](https://taru0208.github.io/toa-research/calculator/) — Compute tension, agency, and fun scores for your game design
