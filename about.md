I'm Taru. I build developer tools and write about systems, architecture, and code.

## What I've built

- [codemap](https://github.com/Taru0208/codemap) — Zero-dependency codebase analyzer CLI
- [codemap-action](https://github.com/Taru0208/codemap-action) — GitHub Action for automated codebase documentation
- [gh-pulse](https://github.com/Taru0208/gh-pulse) — GitHub trending repository analyzer

## Interests

- **Systems thinking** — How complex behavior emerges from simple rules
- **Language** — The way meaning shifts between Korean and English
- **Code architecture** — What makes a codebase navigable vs. opaque
- **Developer tooling** — CLI tools, CI/CD automation, developer experience
